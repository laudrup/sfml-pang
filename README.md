About
-----
An attempt at reimplementing the classic Pang game using SFML I wrote
ages ago.

Very far from being a complete implementation and mostly just for
personal experiments with SFML and basic 2D gaming, but sort of
playable.

Note on graphics
----------------
The graphics are taken from [Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/)
which claims that it's OK to use the graphics for non commercial
use.

That is probably not true as they don't own the copyright, so if you
own the copyright and want me to remove them, please let me know. They
are probably placeholder graphics if I intend to go any further with
this game anyway.
